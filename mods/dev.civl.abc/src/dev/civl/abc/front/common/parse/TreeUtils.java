	 * <p>
	 * I know ANTLR is supposed to do this but I don't think it does it right.
	 * First, the tokenIndexes are not always what I expect. For some reason,
	 * ANTLR's CommonTokenStream sets the index of the last token (EOF) to be
	 * one higher than it should be, so there is a gap in the indexes between
	 * the penultimate token and the last token. I introduced my own "index"
	 * field to CToken (which extends CommonToken) and set it myself correctly.
	 * </p>
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * Second, ANTLR is supposed to find the range of tokens spanned by each
	 * node in the tree (by examining all descendants of the node). However:
	 * first, the code that does this uses ANTLR's tokenIndex, and I want to do
	 * it using my index. Second, the ANTLR code is only correct under the
	 * assumption that the token indices are non-decreasing as child index
	 * increases, i.e., the token index of child i is less than or equal to that
	 * of child i+1, for all i, for all nodes. (Hence it only has to examine the
	 * first and last child.) There is no reason that assumption has to hold. So
	 * I compute this correctly (and using CToken indexes) and re-set the
	 * "tokenStartIndex" and "tokenStopIndex" fields of each tree node.
