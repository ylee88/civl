/**
 * <p>
 * An abstract representation of a preprocessor macro. Used to represent both
 * object and function macros.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * C11 5.1.1.2(3) states that in translation phase 3 (in which the source is
 * decomposed into preprocessing tokens): "Whether each nonempty sequence of
 * white-space characters other than new-line is retained or replaced by one
 * space character is implementation-defined." Note that in the vocabulary of
 * C11, white-space characters are not preprocessing tokens; they are used to
 * separate preprocessing tokens.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * A {@link Macro} object maintains the sequence of all tokens in the macro
 * definition body, including the white space tokens. This is called the body
 * token sequence. The subsequence consisting of the non-whitespace tokens is
 * knows as the replacement token sequence (in accord with the vocabulary of
 * C11). To repeat: the replacement token sequence is a subsequence of the body
 * token sequence. This interface provides methods for navigating both
 * sequences.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The <strong>index</strong> of a token in the macro definition body is its
 * index in the body token sequence, counting from 0. Hence the body tokens have
 * indexes 0, 1, ..., numBodyTokens-1. The <strong>replacement ID</strong> of a
 * replacement token R is the number of replacement tokens that occur before R
 * in the body; hence the replacement tokens have IDs 0, 1, 2, ...,
 * numReplacementTokens-1.
