/**
 * <p>
 * This {@link ContractNode} represents an "mpi event", which represents a set
 * of specific actions that a process performs during runtime.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>There are four kinds of "mpi event": SENDTO, SENDFROM, ENTER and EXIT.
 *
 * <p>
 * The SENDTO(dests, tags) event represents the set of send actions which
 * sends messages to the given set of destinations (dests) with the given set of
 * message tags (tags),  performed by the running process.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The SENDFROM(srcs, tags) event represents the set of send actions which sends
 * messages from the given set of source processes (srcs) to the running process
 * with the given message tags (tags).
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The ENTER(p) event is associated to a function "f".  It represents the action
 * that a process p enters the function "f".  If the argument p is absent, it
 * represents the action performed by the running process.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The EXIT(p) event is associated to a function "f".  It represents the action
 * that a process p exits the function "f".  If the argument p is absent, it
 *  * represents the action performed by the running process.
