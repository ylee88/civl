 * method {@link #generateTasks()} will be called once all current unit tasks
 * have been executed. This method will usually use the executor to inspect the
 * state of translation --- e.g., to see which header files were included by the
 * preprocessor. It may also keep some history. It can use this information
 * however it likes to generate new unit tasks. These will be added to the work
 * list and the executor will execute them. Repeat until no new tasks are
 * generated.
