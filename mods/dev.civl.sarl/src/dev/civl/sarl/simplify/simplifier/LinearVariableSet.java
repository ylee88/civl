 * A structured representation of a set of {@link Monic}s. The {@link Monic}s
 * are divided into two types: integer and real. In each case, the {@link Monic}
 * s are ordered in an array, the order coming from a specified
 * {@link Comparator} of {@link Monic}s, or from the
 * {@link IdealFactory#monicComparator()}. Each monic is assigned an ID number,
 * unique among the monics of its type in this set. The numbers start from 0.
 * There are methods to go back and forth between the ID numbers and the
 * {@link Monic}s, and other methods.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This representation is built in a series of stages. First, it is instantiated
 * and the set of monics is empty. Then, the client invokes method
 * {@link #addKeys(Set)} some number of times to add {@link Monic}s to this set.
 * There may be repeated entries; entries after the first will simply be
 * ignored. When the client is finished, it must call {@link #finish()}. Then it
 * can use the other methods to get ID numbers, etc.
