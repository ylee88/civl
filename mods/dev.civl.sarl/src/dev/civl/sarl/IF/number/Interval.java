/**
 * An instance of Interval represents a numeric interval. It can have either
 * real or integer type. It can be open or closed on the left, open or closed on
 * right. It can be unbounded on either side.<br>
 * 
 * <strong>Definitions</strong>:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>if the the type of <code>this</code> is integral, then the upper and
 * lower bounds must be instances of {@link IntegerNumber}, else they must be
 * instances of {@link RationalNumber}</li>
 * 
 * <li>if the bound is exclusive/open/strict, the corresponding
 * <code>strictLower</code> (or <code>strictUpper</code>) must be
 * <code>true</code>.</li>
 * 
 * <li>the lower bound must be less than or equal to the upper bound (Otherwise,
 * this method will return an empty interval.)</li>
 * 
 * <li>if the bounds are <strong>finite</strong> and equal: either (1) both
 * <code>strictLower</code> and <code>strictUpper</code> will be
 * <code>false</code>, or (2) <code>strictLower</code> and
 * <code>strictUpper</code> will be <code>true</code> and the upper and lower
 * bounds will be 0. The first case represents an interval consisting of a
 * single point; the second case represents the empty interval.</li>
 * 
 * <li>if the <strong>lower bound</strong> <code>lower</code> is infinite, it
 * must be a <strong>negative</strong> infinity. And if the <strong>upper
 * bound</strong> <code>upper</code> is infinite, it must be a
 * <strong>positive</strong> infinity.</li>
 * 
 * <li>if <code>isIntegral</code> is <strong><code>true</code></strong>: if the
 * lower bound is finite then <code>strictLower</code> must be
 * <code>false</code>; if the upper bound is finite then
 * <code>strictUpper</code> must be <code>false</code>.</li>
 * 
 * <li>if the bound is {@link RealInfinity}, then the corresponding strict must be
 * <code>true</code>.</li>
 * </ul>
