/* NOTE by WenhaoWu (wuwenhao@udel.edu)
 * This example is modified so that the bound can be adjusted 
 * by defining 'N' and if it isn't defined then the bound value 
 * in the original example is used as the default value of 'N' 
 * And both 'argc' and 'argv' are assumed by using '$assume', 
 * which is included in <civlc.cvh>.
